Movie Recommender System

Overview

This Movie Recommender System is designed to provide personalized movie recommendations using a combination of content-based and collaborative filtering techniques to enhance accuracy. Additionally, Natural Language Processing (NLP) is applied to perform sentiment analysis on movie reviews, helping the system to further fine-tune recommendations based on user feedback. The system has a Python-powered backend and a JavaScript-based frontend.

Features

Content-based Filtering: Recommends movies based on the similarity of features (genres, actors, directors, etc.) to what a user has already liked.

Collaborative Filtering: Utilizes user interaction data (ratings, preferences) to find movies based on similar usersâ€™ preferences.

Sentiment Analysis: Uses NLP to analyze user reviews and incorporates this data into the recommendation algorithm.

User Interface: An intuitive JavaScript-based front-end for users to view recommendations and submit reviews.

Tech Stack

Backend: Python

Front-end: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
